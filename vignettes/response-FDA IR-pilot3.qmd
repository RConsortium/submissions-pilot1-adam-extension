Re: Response to FDA’s Statistical Review and Evaluation Summary of the R 
Consortium R submission Pilot 3 eCTD submission

Dear Sir/Madam:

On February 2, 2024, the R Consortium R submission Working Group received FDA’s 
Statistical Review and Evaluation Summary of the R Consortium R submission Pilot 
3 submission. The working group would like to thank FDA staff for the 
comprehensive review and thoughtful recommendations. We are thrilled to learn 
that the FDA staff was able to reproduce the ADaM (Analysis Data Model) datasets 
as well as the analysis outputs using the R programs and the proprietary R package 
submitted through the eCTD portal.

The purpose of this letter is to provide the working group’s responses to FDA’s 
Statistical Review and Evaluation Summary of the R Consortium R submission Pilot 
3. The following information is provided in response to the findings from FDA 
Staff’s review.

[**Agency Comment 1**]{.underline}

The agency found issues switching between R versions. The FDA would like the WG 
\[Working Group\] to explore the impact of different versions of R, RStudio and 
RTools, as well as Linux vs. Windows

[**The R Consortium R Submission Working Group Response**]{.underline}

It is recommended by the WG to download and install the R and R Studio versions 
specified in the ADRG. Switching to other versions, not specified, could most 
likely be the cause of issues when running the R ADaM and analysis output programs. 
Certain versions of the R packages used in these programs only correspond to the 
specified R version.

Regarding RTools, referencing the installation instructions on its website,

*"Rtools42 is only needed for installation of R packages from source or building 
R from source. R can be installed from the R binary installer and by default will 
install binary versions of CRAN packages, which does not require Rtools42.*

*Moreover, online build services are available to check and build R packages for 
Windows, for which again one does not need to install Rtools42 locally. The 
Winbuilder check service uses identical setup as the CRAN incomming packages 
checks and has already all CRAN and Bioconductor packages pre-installed."*^1^

As discussed in the R Consortium R Submission Working Group, *"It appears that 
the most practical path forward as to what preemptive measures sponsors can take 
to match submission environments with the FDA test environment is to work with 
the FDA to lock down the environment as best as can be done just prior to 
submission."*^2^

For Linux vs Windows, many others in the R community have asked a similar question 
with responses such as, *"R programming language is well-suited for both Windows 
and Linux operating systems. It is an open-source programming language, so it can 
be used on a variety of platforms. The choice between Windows and Linux depends 
on your specific needs, familiarity with the operating systems, and the tools 
and packages you plan to use with R. Both platforms have their own advantages 
and it ultimately comes down to personal preference and the specific requirements 
of your project."*^3^

For the Pilot 3 project team, due to cross-industry collaboration, Linux was the 
best option for us to work in allowing us work in a stable R environment. At the 
time of final testing of the programs in this package, we did test in the Windows 
environment as well to ensure all programs were still running as expected with 
matching results as was output in Linux.

[**Agency Comment 2**]{.underline}

Explore these differences between generated Pilot 3 ADaM and CDISC data sets :

-   attributes,

-   types (e.g. integer vs. double),

-   NA vs. NULL

[**The R Consortium R Submission Working Group Response**]{.underline}

The Pilot 3 project team explored all differences between the original CDISC 
datasets generated in SAS vs the Pilot 3 datasets generated in R. More detailed 
findings are documented in Appendix 2 of the ADRG in the section 'QC findings'. 
To address the agency's concerns, we explored these specific discrepancies that 
are present that could impact the analysis results.

These were the checks we ran below, with a final response below these checks.

The team used three different packages for these checks :

```         
  library(arsenal)
  library(diffdf)
  library(waldo)
  
  path <- list(sdtm = "~/submissions-pilot3-adam/submission/sdtm",
               adam = "~/submissions-pilot3-adam/submission/adam",
               cdisc = "~/submissions-pilot3-adam/adam")
```

***ADSL***

```         
adsl <- read_xpt(file.path(path$adam, "adsl.xpt"))  
adsl_cdisc <- read_xpt(file.path(path$cdisc, "adsl.xpt"))

arsenal::comparedf(adsl, adsl_cdisc)
diffdf::diffdf(adsl, adsl_cdisc, keys = c("STUDYID", "USUBJID"))
waldo::compare(adsl, x_arg = "new", adsl_cdisc, y_arg = "old")


`attr(new, 'label')` is a character vector ('Subject-Level Analysis Dataset')
`attr(old, 'label')` is absent
```

The difference found here is that Pilot 3 ADSL includes the dataset label per 
the define.xml, whereas the CDISC ADSL dataset label was blank. No impact on the 
analysis itself.

{{< pagebreak >}}

***ADTTE***

```         
adtte <- read_xpt(file.path(path$adam, "adtte.xpt"))
adtte_cdisc <- read_xpt(file.path(path$cdisc, "adtte.xpt"))

arsenal::comparedf(adtte, adtte_cdisc)
diffdf::diffdf(adtte, adtte_cdisc, keys = c("STUDYID", "USUBJID")) 
waldo::compare(adtte, x_arg = "new", adtte_cdisc, y_arg = "old")

  ================================================
   VARIABLE  ATTR_NAME   VALUES.BASE  VALUES.COMP 
  ------------------------------------------------
     AGE     format.sas     NULL           3      
    AGEGR1   format.sas     NULL          $5      
   AGEGR1N   format.sas     NULL           3      
   EVNTDESC  format.sas     NULL          $25     
    PARAM    format.sas     NULL          $32     
   PARAMCD   format.sas     NULL          $4      
     RACE    format.sas     NULL          $32     
    RACEN    format.sas     NULL           3      
    SAFFL    format.sas     NULL          $1      
     SEX     format.sas     NULL          $1      
  ------------------------------------------------
```

The differences found in ADTTE were just metadata attributes where these listed 
variables had SAS formats in the CDISC SAS datasets, whereas the Pilot 3 R 
datasets did not have these SAS formats. These did not have any impact on the 
analysis itself.

{{< pagebreak >}}

***ADAE***

```         
adae <- read_xpt(file.path(path$adam, "adae.xpt"))
adae_cdisc <- read_xpt(file.path(path$cdisc, "adae.xpt"))

arsenal::comparedf(adae, adae_cdisc)
diffdf::diffdf(adae, adae_cdisc, keys = c("STUDYID", "USUBJID", "AESEQ"))
waldo::compare(adae, x_arg = "new", adae_cdisc, y_arg = "old")

=======================================================================================
   VARIABLE  ATTR_NAME             VALUES.BASE                      VALUES.COMP          
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADURN      label          Analysis Duration (N)               AE Duration (N)    
  
  ADURU      label         Analysis Duration Units             AE Duration Units      
  
  AOCCFL     label    1st Occurrence within Subject ...  1st Occurrence of Any AE Flag 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The differences shown in ADAE were only variable labels, which also did not 
have any impact on the analysis.

***ADLBC***

```         
adlbc <- read_xpt(file.path(path$adam, "adlbc.xpt"))
adlbc_cdisc <- read_xpt(file.path(path$cdisc, "adlbc.xpt"))

arsenal::comparedf(adlbc, adlbc_cdisc)
diffdf::diffdf(adlbc, adlbc_cdisc, keys = c("STUDYID", "USUBJID", "LBSEQ", 
"PARAMCD", "AVISIT")) 
waldo::compare(adlbc, x_arg = "new", adlbc_cdisc, y_arg = "old")

  ==================================
   VARIABLE  CLASS.BASE  CLASS.COMP 
  ----------------------------------
     ADT        Date      numeric   
    TRTEDT      Date      numeric   
    TRTSDT      Date      numeric   
  ----------------------------------
```

The differences in ADLBC, were only regarding date variables, where the Pilot 3 
R dataset rightly attributed these variables as dates as oppose to just a numeric 
value.

{{< pagebreak >}}

***ADADAS***

```         
adadas <- read_xpt(file.path(path$adam, "adadas.xpt"))
adadas_cdisc <- read_xpt(file.path(path$cdisc, "adadas.xpt"))

arsenal::comparedf(adadas, adadas_cdisc)
diffdf::diffdf(adadas, adadas_cdisc, keys = c("STUDYID", "USUBJID", "QSSEQ", 
"PARAMCD", "AVISIT"))
waldo::compare(adadas, x_arg = "old", adadas_cdisc, y_arg = "new")

========================================================================================
VARIABLE  ATTR_NAME            VALUES.BASE                     VALUES.COMP            
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANL01FL    label            Analysis Flag 01             Analysis Record Flag 01      
ITTFL      label    Intent-To-Treat Population Flag  Intent-to-Treat Population Flag 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The differences shown in ADADAS were also only variable labels, which also did not 
have any impact on the analysis.

Any difference in attributes are because Pilot 3 ensures that the datasets are 
labelled according to the define.xml and that there is traceability and transparency. 
We found that these differences in attributes had no impact on the results.

Regarding differences between types (integer vs double). The impact on a discrepancy 
such as this will be in the accuracy of the results when a double is defined as 
integer. In this project these differences also had no impact on the results.

We also did not see any result discrepancies between NA vs NULL.^12^ These observed 
differences had no impact on the results.

In conclusion, the discrepancies found between the Pilot 3 vs the CDISC ADaMs 
were all metadata related. The team was unable to identify any of these issues 
impacting the analysis.

[**Agency Comment 3**]{.underline}

In the eSub Package, the proprietary Pilot 3 package had the incorrect package 
name {pilot3} instead of {pilot3utils}. For one of the file names, it was renamed 
from Pilot 3.xlsx to adam-pilot-3.xlsx.

[**The R Consortium R Submission Working Group Response**]{.underline}

The Pilot 3 package and the .xlsx files are now correctly named to {pilot3utils}^1^ 
and adam-pilot-3.xlsx, respectively. These are now referenced as so in the Pilot 
3 ADaM and analysis output programs as well as the ADRG.

[**Agency Comment 4**]{.underline}

File path - Relative vs Full path name. The location of a directory was specified 
using relative file path, where the Agency recommends specifying and using the 
full path.

[**The R Consortium R Submission Working Group Response**]{.underline}

This has been updated in the ADRG with further detailed notes on how to specify 
the full file path upon execution of the R programs.

[**Agency Comment 5**]{.underline}

Different primary output in Pilot 1 and Pilot 3

-   There are discrepancies between Pilot 3 ADaM and CDISC datasets

-   Discrepancies are noted in QC findings in ADRG

[**The R Consortium R Submission Working Group Response**]{.underline}

Upon the Pilot 3 team's investigation, they noted that there are 818 available 
records in the QS domain. The CDISC ADADAS only brought in 799 records and 
imputed the rest, whereas Pilot 3 brought in all available 818 records into 
ADADAS and then imputed. When the Pilot 3 team adjusted by subsetting to 
ANL01FL=‘Y’ records first before doing the LOCF imputation the results matched 
Pilot 1 and the discrepancy was resolved.^1^
